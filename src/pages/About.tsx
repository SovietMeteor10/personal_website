          Hello! I decided to build my own website as a challenge for myself to
          learn a new programming language, in this case React.js. It found it
          really enjoyable and relished the creative aspect of designing the
          site. It also serves as a more customisable LinkedIn alternative for
          advertising myself, my interests, and projects I am working on.
          <br />
          <br />
          So let me start again.
          <br />
          <br />
          My name is Anthony Duncalf, I graduated from the University of Bristol
          in 2021 with a first class honours degree in Physics and I currently
          work in commodities trading as a risk analyst. I have previous
          experience as a data scientist and venture capitalist. Possibly my
          most exciting endeavour was as the founder of a tech startup that
          sought to build a multi-user AR mobile application. Whilst my first
          venture came to an end earlier this year, I am determined to fulfil my
          passion for building small businesses in the future. In the meantime,
          I am working hard to up-skill myself in areas I am passionate about
          such as machine learning, deep learning, statistics, algorithms, and
          global markets. My medium-term aim is to become proficient in several
          of these areas and move into a developer role at a markets-based
          financial firm, ideally specialising in algorithm optimisation and AI.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am an avid sports person, having previously won the national
          championships in Shotokan Karate and Rowing. I continue to enjoy
          exercise and have recently developed an interest in hiking and
          mountaineering. I love travelling, photography, and astronomy and
          dedicate most of my free time to these pursuits. I am also an avid
          reader and am always looking to learn new things through literature,
          so if you have any reading recommendations, please reach out! I also
          enjoy listening to long-form podcasts and watching sports such as
          football, F1, and athletics. I am a die-hard Liverpool FC fan and if I
          could, would be at every game.
          <br />
