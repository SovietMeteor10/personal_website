          Hello! My name is Anthony Duncalf and thank you for visiting my
          website. Its difficult to decide what to write about. I find it
          difficult to define a job title for myself. I work in commodities, but
          have experience as a data scientist and venture capitalist. My most
          exciting endeavour was as an entrepreneur where I set about building
          an AR mobile application. Unfortunately, my first attempt at a startup
          fell short of the mark, but I am determined to fulfil my passion for
          building small businesses and use lessons learned to succeed next
          time!
