            A client facing role in which I built upon existing financial models
            using Python and Microsoft Excel and conducted multi-variate
            regression data analysis for a sustainable financial products team.

            eco-financial instruments. Being part of a small team exposed me to
            various operations within the business and gave me a greater
            understanding of financial markets.
