            I currently work as a Product Controller at Petroineos, a
            commodities trading firm based in London. I fall under the risk
            department and am responsible for accurately reporting on trading
            PnL and assessing the overall health of active positions relative to
            trading limits. My role involves python programming and excel skills
            and during my time I taught myself VBA for automating my work flow
            and report production.

            Founder of my own augmented reality mobile app startup and worked in
            my own time managing the team and its operations using agile
            methods. I was responsible for the product management, marketing and
            finances of the business (including fund raising and grant

            been vital to the companyâ€™s success and is something I bring to
            everything I do.

            the investment teams to review and construct the architecture for a
            new CRM system. I used Dynamics, Excel, Word, Powerpoint, PowerBI,
            Zendesk and Mailchimp to optimise data processing systems for client
            communication, data storage.

            A client facing role in which I built upon existing financial models
            using Python and Microsoft Excel and conducted multi-variate
            regression data analysis for a sustainable financial products team.
            I mainly worked in carbon markets and developed a keen interest in
            eco-financial instruments. Being part of a small team exposed me to
            various operations within the business and gave me a greater
            understanding of financial markets.
